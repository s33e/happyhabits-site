BELIEFS AFFECT PHYSIOLOGY
One of the greatest performances in the history of individual sports belongs to a runner named Roger Bannister. He was the first to run one English mile in under 4 minutes. Bannister is a perfect example of how belief and expecting a certain goal can lead to success.

In 1946, Bannister was studying medicine at Oxford University and spent all of his free time training for medium-distance running. At the time, everyone thought that running a mile in under 4 minutes was impossible. Bannister believed that it could be done and that it was just another record that could be beaten.

He participated in the 1952 Olympics as a gold medal favourite. Unfortunately, Bannister didn’t finish in the first three; he was very disappointed and considered giving up running. But since he loved the sport, he decided to keep trying and set an even more ambitious goal: he wanted to be the first to run an English mile in under 4 minutes.

With the help of his friends Chris Brasher and Chris Chataway, Bannister created a strategy to fulfill his goal. Brasher and Chataway had to maintain the speed necessary to break the record. However, since neither of them was able to run the full course at the necessary pace, they took turns leading the run.

In 1954 it was time to try the impossible and Bannister decided to do it on Iffley Road, England. Many spectators and photographers showed up. After take-off, Chris Brasher began to lead the race and set the pace. Bannister was right behind him and Chataway was third. Then Chataway started leading and setting the pace. Bannister was second, but 250 yards before the finish line he spurted ahead, crossed the finish line, and collapsed due to exhaustion."

Elon Musk described this as follows:

Somebody could say, “Battery packs are costly, and that’s just the way they will always be… Historically, it has cost $600 per kilowatt-hour. It’s not going to be much better than that in the future.”
 
With the first principles, you say, “What are the material constituents of the batteries? 
What is the stock market value of the material constituents?”
 
It’s got cobalt, nickel, aluminium, carbon, some polymers for separation, and a sealed can. 

Break that down on a material basis and say, “If we bought that on the London Metal Exchange, what would each of those things cost?”
 
It’s like $80 per kilowatt hour. So clearly, you just need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell, and you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper than anyone realizes."""

Metaphor, not memorisation, is the key to learning. If you understand A, and B is like A but a little different, then you understand B.

Metaphors help us move from A to B and find our orientation when encountering something new.

Understanding metaphor is a skill. 

We can get better at it. 

Find something difficult and decode it.

Human thinking depends on metaphor. We understand new or complex things in relation to things we already know. For example, it's hard to think about life in general, but once you apply the metaphor ""life is a journey,"" the metaphor guides you to some conclusions: You should learn the terrain, pick a direction, find some good traveling companions, and enjoy the trip, because there may be nothing at the end of the road."""

Backgammon teaches that not everything will work. We don’t have to fear defeat. Not everything is in our power. We can’t always only roll double six. 

It also teaches that life means community. If you leave a checker alone it is vulnerable. We are stronger when we are together.

It doesn’t matter if the answer is correct, just the answer itself makes us feel safe. - Don Miguel Ruiz, The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide To Personal Freedom ---- Don’t make assumptions . Take a moment and think about all the times you’ve made an assumption that’s turned out to be wrong. From the beginning, as we’ve been domesticated into society, we’ve been trained to always crave safety. We make assumptions because they make us feel safe. We’re scared of the unknown and we’re scared of asking questions. So, we invent answers to the questions we’re too scared to ask. And it doesn’t matter if the answer is correct, “just the answer itself makes us feel safe,” Ruiz writes. We often think questions like this but never ask them. And because we never ask them, we create our own answers. Instead of assuming answers we should ask questions first .

The fourth mouse touches the leg and says that the elephant is like a tree. The fifth mouse touches the side and says the elephant is like a wall. The sixth mouse touches the tail and says the elephant is like a rope. Each mouse is certain that it is right, and that everyone else is wrong. The lesson Don't attribute to malice, ignorance, or stupidity what can be explained by different information. ---- What have you changed your mind on recently?Egocentric Bias says that we convince ourselves of the accuracy of our own personal perspective and therefore struggle to acknowledge any perspectives or data that may alter our understanding of the world. The parable of The Blind Men and The Elephant tells the story of six blind men who examine one part of an elephant and each come to very different conclusions on what an elephant is. They are all partly right, but also all entirely wrong. The information you have about the world represents a tiny fraction of the information available, yet you use it to form a view of how the world works. Remember the Blind Men Razor: ""Never attribute to malice, ignorance, or stupidity that which can be adequately explained by different information."" Six blind men are brought to examine an elephant that has come to their village. The first man touches the trunk and says that the elephant is like a thick snake. The second man touches the tusk and says that the elephant is like a spear. The third man touches the ear and says that the elephant is like a fan. The fourth man touches the leg and says that the elephant is like a tree. The fifth man touches the side and says the elephant is like a wall. The sixth man touches the tail and says the elephant is like a rope.

378,lollipop-trick,Lollipop Trick,"🍭 If your solution doesn’t work, reframe the problem - The Canadian police faced issues with rowdy clubbers causing disturbances in the streets. They tried everything from closing clubs early to increasing police shifts. Nothing worked. Until they introduced the lollipop initiative. Handing out free lollipops to the clubbers. Now the clubbers had their mouths busy. Shouting and vandalising stopped. The issue disappeared over night. Lesson When conventional logic doesn’t work, reframe the problem. ---- Canadian police dealt with rowdy clubbers causing disturbances in the streets every weekend. - Traditional approaches like early club closures and increased police shifts failed to address the problem effectively. - The police introduced a solution by distributing free lollipops to clubbers, keeping them occupied and reducing incidents significantly. drunk clubbers waited for taxis or buses to go home after leaving a club. And they had nothing to do while waiting. So they spent their excessive energy from alcohol shouting and vandalizing the streets. Clubbers were hungry after drinking and dancing for hours. They happily took the free lollipops. Now their mouths were busy. So they couldn’t shout. That meant fewer bravados that led to street fights. And no more vandalism as they were focused on lollipops. So the problems on that street magically disappeared overnight. Lollipops cost a few cents each. And it was nothing compared with the savings from reduced police shifts and vandalism. Instead of trying to solve a problem with conventional logic, you reframe the problem."

You can either tell yourself you’re a “failure” and stop playing, or you can work extra hard to make sure this never happens again."
455,feelings-and-needs,Feelings And Needs,"🎭 Listen to feelings to discover underlying needs // Often, it's not what is said or done, but what we make of it that impacts how we experience something. When people do things we don't like, it's just a tragic expression of unmet needs.

456,stop-reading,Stop Reading,"🛑 The rule of thumb for reading ... // Life is too short to read books you don't enjoy. And there are too many books you might love. The rule of thumb is 100 pages minus your age. So, if you're 70 years old and don't love a book 30 pages in, stop reading!"
457,junk-rules,Junk Rules,"🗑️ Have clear ""junk rules"" // Make clear rules about when to throw out old junk. Once clear rules are in place, junk will no longer be a problem.
